An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it.

A single decision tree splits the features of the input vector - in our case the bits of the fingerprints - in a way that maximizes an correct predictions. In the random forest algorithm a lot of different discision trees are generated, however these trees are de-correlated because the choice of features - the bits of the fingerprints - that a tree can use, are chosen randomly for each tree.

        "    * There might be several reasons why the random forest machine models performed best. Our dataset might be easily separable in active/inactive with some simple tree-like decisions, respectively. Thus, there is not such a complex pattern in the fingerprints to do this classification.\n",
        "    * A cause for the slightly poorer performance of the ANN could be that there was simply too few data to train the model on. ANNs are infamous for their requirement of a lot of data for training.\n",

        "    * Obviously, MACCS was good to start training and validating models to see if a classification is possible. \n",
        "    * However, MACCS keys are rather short (166 bit) compared to others (2048 bit), as for example Morgan fingerprint. As you might expect, having longer fingerprint can help the learning process. \n",

        "* An example for a large screening data set is e.g. [MolPort](https://www.molport.com/shop/database-download) with over 7 million compounds.\n",
        "* Our models could be used to rank the MolPort compounds and then further study those with the highest predicted probability of being active.\n",
